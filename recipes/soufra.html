    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>
      It’s an eye-catching Greek custard cake made with buttered phyllo dough
      that has been folded and crinkled in a wide baking pan or dish, or a
      springform pan. The dough is baked until golden brown. Then, a thick and
      creamy custard is poured over the top with other ingredients, and it’s
      baked again until the custard sets.
    </p>
    <p>
      A soufra can be savory or sweet. In the case of our Lemon Blueberry Soufra
      – the custard is sweetened with sugar and flavored with vanilla and lemon
      zest. Then fresh blueberries are sprinkled on top before baking.
